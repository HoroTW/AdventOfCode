# 🎄 Advent of Code 2021 🎄

## Summary

This year I will post my solutions to the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/), even though I think they are nothing special.
I'm also writing my bachelor thesis right now, so I'm not sure if I'll do all the puzzles - but we'll see 😎.

## Overview

| Day                                       | Name        | Status | Notes  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| [01](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1) | Sonar Sweep |  ⭐⭐  | I think the pandas solution looks nice (a one liner each 😎) - also there is a nice trick in it that shows that the puzzle is solvable without an sliding window 😉. |
| [02](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2) | Dive!       |  ⭐⭐  | The solution was really straight forward and only little code was needed. |
