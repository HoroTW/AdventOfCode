# 🎄 Advent of Code 2021 🎄

## Summary

This year I will post my solutions to the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/), even though I think they are nothing special.
I'm also writing my bachelor thesis right now, so I'm not sure if I'll do all the puzzles - but we'll see 😎.

## Overview

| Day                                       | Name                  | Status | Notes  |
| ----------------------------------------- | -----------------     | ------ | ------ |
| [01](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1) | Sonar Sweep           |  ⭐⭐  | I think the pandas solution looks nice (a one liner each 😎) - also there is a nice trick in it that shows that the puzzle is solvable without an sliding window 😉. |
| [02](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2) | Dive!                 |  ⭐⭐  | The solution was really straight forward and only little code was needed. |
| [03](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3) | Binary Diagnostic     |  ⭐⭐  | I did some `beautiful` (in my opinion not really) python magic |
| [04](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4) | Giant Squid           |  ⭐⭐  | Here the python magic was nice 😊 - also I used a class for the board. |
| [05](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5) | Hydrothermal Venture  |  ⭐⭐  | This was just fun 😊 - I wanted to avoided creating a `line` or a `point` class - so I made heavy use of tuples and list comprehensions |
| [06](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6) | Lanternfish           |  ⭐⭐  | A little growth simulation was fun and I learned something about the `defaultdict`. |
